# 🎮 Steam Game Review Analysis Using NLP and Clustering

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/caiohutis/Steam-Game-Review-Analysis-Using-NLP-and-Clustering.svg?style=flat-square)

Welcome to the **Steam Game Review Analysis** project! This repository showcases a detailed approach to analyzing user reviews from top-selling games on the Steam platform. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques, we aim to uncover valuable insights from user feedback. 

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, we focus on several key objectives:

1. **Bug Detection**: We implement keyword filtering to identify reviews that mention bugs or issues within games. This helps developers understand user concerns and prioritize fixes.
  
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: We assess user sentiment, categorizing reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. This analysis provides a clear picture of user satisfaction.

3. **Clustering Similar Games**: Using clustering methods, we group similar games based on user reviews. This allows for easier comparisons and recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: To process and analyze text data.
- **Machine Learning**: For sentiment analysis and clustering algorithms.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive dashboard to visualize results.
- **Data Analytics**: To derive insights from user reviews.
